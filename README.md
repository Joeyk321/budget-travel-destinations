## Notes

During development, I encountered some challenges with:
- Setting up the Express.js routes properly for dynamic destination pages
- Ensuring PicoCSS compatibility while adding custom styling
- Making the design responsive across different screen sizes
- Getting the navigation between list and detail views to work smoothly

The most rewarding part was seeing the beautiful card-based layout come together and creating smooth hover animations that make the destinations feel interactive and engaging.
